========

1. Quote Service
    The 'Get quote' service allows for obtaining shipping quotes from carriers integrated with Ship2Anywhere.
    
    Example: 
    
    # import s2a api client
    from s2a_api_client  import quote
    
    # create object
    api_url = "https://api.s2asandbox.com/v1.0/"
    quote_service = quote.QuoteService(api_url)
    
    # get quote
    request = {} # add python structure for Quote Service 
    r = quote_service.get_quote(request) # method returns dictionary
                                         # compilant with JSON structure
                                         # for Quote Response
    
2. Order Service
    a. Create order
    The 'Create order' service initializes the booking process.
    
    Example: 
    
    # import s2a api client
    from s2a_api_client import order

    # create object
    api_url = "https://api.s2asandbox.com/v1.0/"
    order_service = order.OrderService(api_url)
    
    # create order
    request = {} # add python structure for Create Order Service
    token = "1234567890" # token from OAuth2.0 service
    r = order_service.create_order(request, token) # method returns dictionary
                                                   # compilant with JSON structure
                                                   # for Order Response
                                                   
    b. Accept order
    After creating an order the client can either accept or cancel it. When the order has been
    accepted (payment information provided), the booking process begins.
    
    Example: 
    
    # import s2a api client
    from s2a_api_client import order

    # create object
    api_url = "https://api.s2asandbox.com/v1.0/"
    order_service = order.OrderService(api_url)
    
    # accept order
    request = {} # add python structure for Create Order Service
    order_id = "S2AO000001" # S2A Order ID
    token = "1234567890" # token from OAuth2.0 service
    r = order_service.accept_order(request, order_id, token) # method returns dictionary
                                                   # compilant with JSON structure
                                                   # for Order Response
                                                   
    c. Accept order
    Cancel created order.
    
    Example: 
    
    # import s2a api client
    from s2a_api_client import order

    # create object
    api_url = "https://api.s2asandbox.com/v1.0/"
    order_service = order.OrderService(api_url)
    
    # accept order
    order_id = "S2AO000001" # S2A Order ID
    token = "1234567890" # token from OAuth2.0 service
    r = order_service.cancel_order(order_id, token) # method returns dictionary
                                                    # compilant with JSON structure
                                                    # for Order Response
                                                    
    d. Fetch order
    The 'Fetch order' service allows for monitoring booking with the polling technique

    from s2a_api_client import order

    # create object
    api_url = "https://api.s2asandbox.com/v1.0/"
    order_service = order.OrderService(api_url)
    
    # accept order
    order_id = "S2AO000001" # S2A Order ID
    token = "1234567890" # token from OAuth2.0 service
    r = order_service.fetch_order(order_id, token) # method returns dictionary
                                                    # compilant with JSON structure
                                                    # for Order Response

    document_service = doc.DocumentService(api_url)
    
    # accept order
    order_id = "S2AO000001" # S2A Order ID
    token = "1234567890" # token from OAuth2.0 service
    r = document_service.download_documents(order_id, token) # method returns dictionary
                                                             # compilant with JSON structure
                                                             # for Documentation Response
    
4. Tracking Service
    Tracking allows for obtaining information concerning the state of the shipment
    
    Example: 
    
    # import s2a api client
    from s2a_api_client import track

    # create object
    api_url = "https://api.s2asandbox.com/v1.0/"
    track_service = track.TrackService(api_url)
    
    # accept order
    tracking_number = "ABC123" # Tracking Number
    r = track_service.track(args.tracking_number) # method returns dictionary
                                                  # compilant with JSON structure
                                                  # for Documentation Response
                                                  
5. S2aApi Class

    # create object
    api_url = "https://api.s2asandbox.com/v1.0/"
    s2a_api = S2aApi(api_url)
    
    # get services
    s2a_api.quote_service.get_quote(...)
    s2a_api.order_service.create_order(...)
    s2a_api.order_service.accept_order(...)
    s2a_api.order_service.cancel_order(...)
